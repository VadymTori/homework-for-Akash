                    <p># **Conceptual Exercise - CSS Fundamentals**</p>                   
                    <p>Explain how CSS differs from HTML in the context of web development.</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">As for me HTML is a skelet of web page that could be filled with different extensions. CSS is one of those, that can change your default design to something special. My first "codding" expirience was started from MS Excel and I was playing a lot with rules called conditional formatting. CSS for me the same: create rules for your existen skelet to make it more special</p>
                    <!-- <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is primarily used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. It provides the skeletal structure of a webpage. On the other hand, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout this content. It determines how the elements are visually presented in terms of color, size, position, etc. In essence, while HTML gives the webpage its structure, CSS gives it its look and feel.</p> -->
                    <p># Question 2 ❓</p>
                    <p>List the methods of including CSS in an HTML document and briefly describe each.</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">External- to separate your code from your stylish rules. Internal- the same like external but use the same file. Make your code hard to read due to big amount of text.Inline- use it only if you know that this rule is going to be used once, but this is very unlikly</p>
                    <!-- <p>- **Inline Styles**: CSS styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. This method is not recommended for large-scale styling because it mixes content (HTML) with presentation (CSS).</p>
                    <p>- **Internal (or Embedded) Styles**: CSS is written between "style" tags in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. This method is used for single-document styling.</p>
                    <p>- **External Styles**: CSS is written in a separate file (typically with a .css extension) and is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This is the preferred method for large websites because it allows for the separation of content and presentation, and styles can be reused across multiple pages.</p>--->
                    <p># Question 3 ❓</p>
                    <p>Describe the anatomy of a CSS rule.</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">Declarrate the name for the css rule and than input parameters for that rule. Nice tone is to leave a comment also</p>
                    <!-- <p>A CSS rule consists of a **selector** and a **declaration block**. The selector specifies which HTML elements the styles will be applied to. The declaration block, enclosed in curly braces (`{}`), contains one or more declarations. Each declaration is a combination of a **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon (`:`) and terminated by a semicolon (`;`).</p> -->
                    <p># Question 4 ❓</p>
                    <p>When might you want to use RGBA instead of RGB?</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">Use additional "A" (RGBA) when you want to add transparent</p>
                    <!-- <p>You would use RGBA instead of RGB when you want to specify a color's opacity (transparency). The "A" in RGBA stands for "Alpha" and can take a value between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque).</p> -->
                    <p># Question 5 ❓</p>
                    <p>How do Hex color values differ from RGB?</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">I use Hex color when I copy\past color from other place and want to do it ident. </p>
                    <!-- <p>Both Hex and RGB are ways to represent colors in CSS. RGB uses three values (one for each red, green, and blue component) that range from 0 to 255. Hex values, on the other hand, use six hexadecimal digits and are a representation of the RGB values. For example, the RGB value `rgb(255,0,0)` corresponds to the Hex value `#FF0000`, both representing the color red.</p> -->
                    <p># Question 6 ❓</p>
                    <p>When might a developer prefer to use HSL over other color formats?</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">Never seen using HSL before. My first time was at the course. Technically you can use it for different chat applications (hello from 2000-2005) to make your chat more uniqe. Probably in some web browser games... This feature should exist as an option, but nowadays it hard to say how you can use it as the only option</p>
                    <!-- <p>HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Developers might prefer HSL when they want more intuitive control over the color variations. Adjusting hue can change the actual color, adjusting saturation can move the color from gray to vivid, and adjusting lightness can make the color darker or lighter. It's especially useful for creating color schemes and variations of a specific color.</p> -->
                    <p># Question 7 ❓</p>
                    <p>What are the primary text properties used in CSS to modify the appearance and layout of text?</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">The answher is depend on person. As for me, my primary requerements are: text position, background (color), text align, distance, wrapping</p>
                    <!-- <p>Some primary text properties include `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `text-transform`, `line-height`, and `text-indent`.</p> -->
                    <p># Question 8 ❓</p>
                    <p>In what scenarios might it be beneficial to use `vh` or `vw` as a unit for font size?</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">I think if you're doing a website that also works on mobile device that can rotate screen to portrait and album positions you shold modify some HMTL code using vw. While vh you can use if part of code\text should always use rules for size itself. Both of them are very specific ap on my own mind</p>
                    <!-- <p>`vh` (viewport height) and `vw` (viewport width) are relative to the size of the viewport. Using these units can be beneficial when you want text to be responsive to the size of the viewport. For instance, if you want a headline always to occupy a certain percentage of the viewport's width or height, using `vh` or `vw` can achieve that.</p> -->
                    <p># Question 9 ❓</p>
                    <p>Explain the difference between `em` and `rem` units.</p>
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">Sometimes you css rules conflict with each others. And you have to prioritize some of them. Use rem for hight priority and cover everything that include that rule. And use em for relative parts of code</p>
                    <!-- <p>Both `em` and `rem` are relative units in CSS. `em` is relative to the font size of its closest parent, whereas `rem` is relative to the root (usually the `<html>`) element's font size. This means if you have nested elements with font sizes specified in `em`, they can compound, while `rem` will always remain consistent relative to the root.</p> -->
                    <p># Question 10 ❓</p>
                    
                    <p>If multiple font families are listed in the font-family property, how does the browser decide which one to display?</p>
                    
                    <p>### Answer 🔑</p>
                    <p class="whiteback">Code goes from top to bottom. Last rule that could be applied will be displayed. Also there are default font families in the browser.</p>
                    <!-- <p>The browser will try to use the fonts in the order they are listed. If the first font is not available on the user's system or through linked font resources, the browser will attempt to use the next font in the list, and so on. It's a fallback mechanism to ensure that if a specific font isn't available, the text can still be displayed in an alternative font.</p> -->
